Version: 2024.09.10 (Brice - 2024/09/10)
- add argument product.limit in predictCox and remove remove predictCoxPL. Side effect: while the influence function for the hazard is unchanged it the influence function relative to the survival scaled by the product limit survival (instead of exponential approximation).
- fix bug in how ties are handled in ate when using the double robust estimator.
- argument fitter in wglm can now take value "prodlim" to use the kaplan-meier or Aalen-Johensen estimator for the censoring weights. 
- argument store.iid in predictCox and predict.CauseSpecificCox has been renamed store and can now be used to reduce memory usage.

Version: 2020.10.01 (Brice - 2020/10/01)
- modification of how ate stores the results: $riskComparison has been split in $diffRisk and $ratioRisk. Gformula is now refered as GFORMULA. Estimates for various estimators are now stores in different lines instead of columns.
- modification of the print function for ate to make it shorter.
- modification of the summary function for ate to have nicer looking tables. 
- autoplot now support smoothing using monotone splines and can also display the first derivative of the spline.

Version: 2020.08.21 (Brice - 2020/08/21)
- calculation of the influence function is now more memory efficient in ate (argument store.iid="minimal")
- confint.ate now can display adjusted p-values (argument p.value=TRUE) and perform one- or two-sided tests (argument alternative).
- autoplot has been improved for predictCox, predict.CauseSpecificCox, and ate objects.

Version: 2018.06.13 (Brice - 06/13/18 3:30)
- confint is now called by predictCox/predictCSC/ate by default.
  If the user wants to apply confint on the output of predictCox/predictCSC/ate,
  he should make sure that se or iid are exported.

Version: 2018.06.01 (Brice - 01/06/18)
- NEW FEATURE: confint function computing confidence interval/bands, possibly using a transformation.

Version: 2018.04.05 (Brice - 04/11/18 9:28)
- ate nows uses the boot package to compute p-values with bootstrap resampling

Version: 1.4.9 (Brice - 2017-09-13)
- predictCox can now compute baseline hazards for left and right censored data
- fix the influence function for the ate
- re-organize the test battery: check the baseline hazard in a separate file.

Version: 1.4.8 (Brice - 2017-09-04)
- re-organize the test battery
- fix the sign of the influence function for the survival

Version: 1.4.7 (Brice - 2017-08-10)
- add progress bar to ate when using foreach

Version: 1.4.6 (Brice - 2017-07-20)
- add the function InfluenceCoxTest comparing survival/risk obtained by two different models
